    <string name="help_1">What is Requisitor? \n Requisitor is an app designed to help MIT students plan out and maintain their class schedules quickly and painlessly. </string>
    <string name="help_2">What can I do on Requisitor? \n You can use Requisitor to explore classes available across departments, check pre-reqs, plan class trajectories throughout your MIT career, taking into account pre-reqs and offering availability. </string>
    <string name="help_3">How do I use “Search Classes”? \n To find a class, limit your search by course, (partial) class number or keyword and scroll to browse. To input a class number or keyword to search, click on the button with a course number followed by a period (in position 1). A keyboard opens and the list updates with every input. To browse by course number or reset the list, click the button with just a course number (in position 2) and select a course from the drop down list. To see a class description, click on the class (as in position 3). To add a class, click on the class, select the term to add to from the drop down menu, and hit “Add Class”.</string>

A context menu as shown below opens. From there, press “Add Another Class” and follow the Search directions. \n Explore: As in the List view, find the semester you want to add to in Explore view and click and hold to open an identical context menu. </string>
    <string name="help_7">How do I remove classes that I have chosen? \n From either List or Explore view, click and hold the class you want to remove. From the context menu that opens, select “Remove” or “Replace”. </string>
    <string name="help_8">How can I see if I have the pre-reqs for a class I am trying to add? \n Enter the class into the semester you are considering it for in Explore view.
